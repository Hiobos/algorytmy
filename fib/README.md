fibonacci-series
Description
This Python project provides a function to calculate the n-th entry in the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceding two.

Usage
main.py
The fib function takes an integer num as input and returns the n-th entry in the Fibonacci series.

Example:
python
Copy code
fib(4)  # Returns: 3
Testing
test.py
The test.py file contains unit tests for the fib function using the unittest module. The tests cover scenarios such as checking if the function is defined, calculating correct Fibonacci values for various inputs, and ensuring accuracy for larger Fibonacci values.

Running Tests
To run the tests, execute test.py in your preferred Python environment.

Example:
bash
Copy code
python test.py
